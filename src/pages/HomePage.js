/**
 * Ordered as the reader's questions arrive: who is this, is anything real here,
 * is it still running, how do they think, what's the scope, can I work with
 * them.
 *
 * Evidence comes second rather than fifth. The first scroll is a contract test
 * — a visitor is deciding whether there is anything behind the claims — and
 * three sections of methodology is the wrong answer to that question.
 *
 * There is exactly one set of navigation, in the header. A second copy at the
 * bottom said the same four things again four screens later, which is the kind
 * of thing that makes a short site feel long.
 *
 * Spacing is set here rather than inside each section because rhythm is a page
 * concern: the wider gaps mark the three movements, and proximity does the
 * grouping that identically-weighted headings cannot.
